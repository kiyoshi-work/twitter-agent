Instead of worrying about\noptimizing for the blockchain layer, developers can focus on building their application to reach product market fit. Not only can\nit scale now for blockchain application needs, but the network continues to be optimized with user experience in mind.",

With blockchains, the user experience is\noften limited by the underlying technology, causing slow response times and high fees.

Users can interact with these\nprograms permissionlessly, removing the need for middleman servers to build applications.400ms Slot TimesEvery transaction sent by\nusers on Solana is confirmed in a block. With a target slot time of 400ms for each block, interactions by users do not have to\nwait, providing the best in class user experience of any blockchain.Low FeesFees on Solana are well known to be low. With a median\nfee of 0.00064 SOL per transaction, Solana enables building for users across the world regardless of background.High\nThroughputScaling to thousands of transactions per second, Solana is built to scale with your application's user needs.\n\n\nHOW TO USE THESE DOCS #\n\nOn the left you will find the docs sidebar.

Solana operates as a single global state machine, and is open, interoperable, and\ndecentralized.\n\n\nWHY SOLANA? #\n\nDesigned to scale, Solana is purpose built for blockchain applications to reach millions of users. Instead of worrying about\noptimizing for the blockchain layer, developers can focus on building their application to reach product market fit. Not only can\nit scale now for blockchain application needs, but the network continues to be optimized with user experience in mind.\n\nBuilding the best user experience in an application is a top priority for developers. With blockchains, the user experience is\noften limited by the underlying technology, causing slow response times and high fees. Solana's low fees and 400ms confirmation\ntimes enable developers to build applications that are user friendly and accessible to everyone.\n\n\nSOLANA FEATURES #",

This means you can\nbuild on top of any program already deployed, and often you can do so without needing to do any custom onchain program\ndevelopment. For example, if you wanted to work with tokens, you could use the Token Program [/docs/core/tokens] that is already\ndeployed on the network.

Transaction fees paid by the submitter, and collected by a\nvalidator, in theory, account for the acute, transactional, costs of validating and adding that data to the ledger. Unaccounted in\nthis process is the mid-term storage of active ledger state, necessarily maintained by the rotating validator set. This type of\nstorage imposes costs not only to validators but also to the broader network as active state grows so does data transmission and\nvalidation overhead. To account for these costs, we describe here our preliminary design and implementation of storage rent.\n\nStorage rent can be paid via one of two methods:\n\nMethod 1: Set it and forget it',

      "Storage rent can be paid via one of two methods:\n\nMethod 1: Set it and forget it\n\nWith this approach, accounts with two-years worth of rent deposits secured are exempt from network rent charges. By maintaining\nthis minimum-balance, the broader network benefits from reduced liquidity and the account holder can rest assured that their\nAccount::data will be retained for continual access/usage.\n\nMethod 2: Pay per byte\n\nIf an account has less than two-years worth of deposited rent the network charges rent on a per-epoch basis, in credit for the\nnext epoch. This rent is deducted at a rate specified in genesis, in lamports per kilobyte-year.\n\nFor information on the technical implementation details of this design, see the Rent\n[https://docs.solanalabs.com/implemented-proposals/rent] section.\n\nNote: New accounts now are required to be initialized with enough lamports to be rent exempt. Additionally, transactions that\nleave an account's balance below the rent exempt minimum (and non-zero) will fail. This essentially renders all accounts rent\nexempt. Rent-paying accounts that were created before this requirement will continue paying rent until either (1) their balance\nfalls to zero, or (2) a transaction increases the account's balance to be rent exempt.",

      "KEYPAIR #\n\nA keypair [/docs/terminology#keypair] is a securely generated secret key [/docs/intro/wallets#secret-key] and its\ncryptographically-derived public key [/docs/intro/wallets#public-key]. A secret key and its corresponding public key are together\nknown as a keypair. A wallet contains a collection of one or more keypairs and provides some means to interact with them.\n\n\nPUBLIC KEY #\n\nThe public key [/docs/terminology#public-key-pubkey] (commonly shortened to pubkey) is known as the wallet's receiving address or\nsimply its address. The wallet address may be shared and displayed freely. When another party is going to send some amount of\ncryptocurrency to a wallet, they need to know the wallet's receiving address. Depending on a blockchain's implementation, the\naddress can also be used to view certain information about a wallet, such as viewing the balance, but has no ability to change\nanything about the wallet or withdraw any tokens.\n\n\nSECRET KEY #\n\nThe secret key [/docs/terminology#private-key] (also referred to as private key) is required to digitally sign any transactions to\nsend cryptocurrencies to another address or to make any changes to the wallet. The secret key must never be shared. If someone\ngains access to the secret key to a wallet, they can withdraw all the tokens it contains. If the secret key for a wallet is lost,\nany tokens that have been sent to that wallet's address are permanently lost.\n\n\nSECURITY #",

If the secret key for a wallet is lost,\nany tokens that have been sent to that wallet's address are permanently lost.\n\n\nSECURITY #\n\nDifferent wallet solutions offer different approaches to keypair security, interacting with the keypair, and signing transactions\nto use/spend the tokens. Some are easier to use than others. Some store and back up secret keys more securely. Solana supports\nmultiple types of wallets so you can choose the right balance of security and convenience.\n\nIf you want to be able to receive SOL tokens on the Solana blockchain, you first will need to create a wallet.\n\n\nSUPPORTED WALLETS #\n\nSeveral browser and mobile app based wallets support Solana. Find some options that might be right for you on the Solana Ecosystem\n[/ecosystem/explore?categories=wallet] page.\n\nFor advanced users or developers, the command-line wallets [https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/wallets] may be more appropriate, as\nnew features on the Solana blockchain will always be supported on the command line first before being integrated into third-party\nsolutions.",
